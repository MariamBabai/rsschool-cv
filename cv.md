### Raccoon Identification Tips
Racco ns have furry coats in brown-gray with ringed tails and a telltale black mask across their eyes. Their ears are pointed and their paws handlike, capable of detailed tasks such as pulling apart objects or unlatching a door. Measuring approximately 3 feet long with a body weight of 10 to 30 pounds, these mammals eat both plant-based and animal-based foods and are known for their _ability to show up in a variety of locations due to climbing and digging skills_.

### Good Things About Raccoons
While you _do not want_ to leave a raccoon problem untreated, these animals do offer certain benefits to your yard. Thanks to their preference for a variety of foods, raccoons help keep your yard free of pests. For example, raccoons will eat wasp larvae, destroying the nest. Raccoons also eat other pests, such as small rodents, keeping your yard free of a variety of problems.
